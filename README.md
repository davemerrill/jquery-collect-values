jquery-collect-values
=====================

https://github.com/davemerrill/jquery-collect-values

A jQuery plug-in that returns an object containing the current values of requested fields within the containers and/or
fields in the matched set. Lots of control over field names, skipped fields, checkbox handling, and more.

Demo and more details to come. For now, there are pretty complete docs in the plug-in source.
